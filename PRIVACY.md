# Privacy Policy for Phocus

*Last Updated: June 18, 2025*

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Phocus" Chrome Extension handles your information. Phocus was built with privacy in mind and is designed to work entirely on your local computer, without sending any of your personal data to us or any third parties.

## 1. What Information We Donâ€™t Collect

A key tenet for strong privacy is not to collect any data that's not needed in the first place. Phocus collects and stores data only to support its main functionality. Phocus does *not* collect, store, or transmit any of the following:

* Your browsing history

* Your IP address or location data

* Any personal information like your name, email address, or account credentials

* Data from your other tabs or extensions

## 2. Information You Choose to Create

The Phocus extension allows you to track your focus sessions. All the data you generate while using the extension is stored only on your local computer using the browser's built-in storage. This data includes:

* **Focus blocks:** The start and end times of the focus blocks you track. Optionally with notes if you choose to provide them.

* **Settings:** Focus goals and various miscellaneous options.

* **Activity:** Previous changes in user activity with a timestamp to support accurate tracking.


## 3. Data Storage and Security

All data created by Phocus is stored locally on your device using the `chrome.storage.local` API, which keeps your data local and isolated from other user profiles and extensions. Phocus does not send data to any external server or cloud service.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not share your data because we never have access to it. Since all your information is stored locally on your device, it is impossible for us, or any third party, to view, access, or share it.

## 5. Your Control Over Your Data

You have complete control over your stored data. You can:

* View and Review: Access your tracked times and notes directly within the extension's interface at any time.

* Modify and Delete: Add, update, or remove focus blocks and notes as needed through the extension's side panel.

* Delete All Data: Simply uninstalling the extension will remove all of its data from your computer.

Please note that Phocus does not guarantee that it will store all data correctly or indefinitely. Bugs may corrupt or delete data and Phocus may unilaterally decide to delete old data.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.

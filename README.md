# Phocus

Phocus is a Chrome extension that helps you track your focus time while working on your computer.

## Features

Assisted time tracking:

* Start, stop, and resume the focus timer via the extension icon.
* If you forgot to start the focus timer, you can retroactively start it from when you to returned your computer.
* If you forgot to stop the timer, you'll get a notification that gives you the option to retroactively stop the timer.
* If your computer is locked before it goes idle, the focus timer will be stopped automatically.

Focus goals:

* Set a goal for how long you'd like your focus blocks to be at least. The focus icon will change when you've reached the goal.
* You can also get a notification when you've reached your focus goal.
* Either way, the timer keeps running until you stop it, so you can stay focused if you're in the zone.

Reporting:

* See your daily focus and pause time in the action popup window.
* Take notes in the popup window what you're currently working on.
* See your focus blocks and pause times in the side panel along with notes of your work.
* You can add, update, and remove focus blocks if you need to patch your tracked focus blocks after the fact.
